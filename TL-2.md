1. **Weather Report (5m)**
  - Flipchart with storm, rain, clouds and sunshine
  - Put your name on a sticky, then put it where you feel about this sprint
2. **Lean Coffee (15m)**
  - Write topics you'd like to discuss, one per sticky
  - Go around, 1 or 2 sentence pitch for each sticky
  - 2 dots vote for what you'd like to talk about
  - Work our way through them (won't get to them all, that's okay)
  - For each topic: after 5 min, vote thumbs up (5 more minutes) or thumbs down (move on to next topic)
3. **Brainstorming / Filtering (10m)**
  - For Lean Coffee stickies that we want to do something about: generate lots of ideas and filter them against your criteria
  - One idea per sticky, at least one idea per person
  - Choose a few filters (time, cost, interest)
  - Mark with a letter things that match the filters
4. **Maximize Follow Through (10m)**
  -  Flipchart with four columns. Try and put a sticky in each. If there's no stickies, do we still want to do it?
    - Action
    - Motivation
    - Ease
    - Reminder
5. **Take Aways (5m)**
  - On a sticky write one thing you learned in the retro.
