1. **What piece of furniture? (5m)**

- Take a sticky note and pen
- Draw a piece of furniture to represent this sprint
- Tell us what your drew and why

(Why? Metaphors are useful for explaining and getting others to understand because it makes your brain make connections and comparisons)

2. **Delay Display (15m)**

- (Mark three columns: Destination, Delay, Announcement.)
- Write on sticky notes. We'll put them up at the end.
- Where's your train going?
- How much of a delay is there?
- What's the announcement?

(Why? Get a fresh angle on delays, without being too serious about it)

3. **Cause-Effect-Diagram (15m)**

- What?
- So what?
- Now what?

(Why? Get to the root cause so that we can do something about it)

4. **Follow Through (5m)**

- Mark a line 0% to 100% on the board
- How likely are we to do this action?
- Write your % on a sticky
- Put it up on the board.
- How can we increase the probability?

(Why? Set ourselves up for success)
