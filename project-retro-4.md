- **Three Words - 10m**. Everybody sums up the project in 3 words.
    - Do this on a sticky, quietly. Then go around the room. Optionally, each person can talk about one of their words.
- **Timeline - 20m**. Participants write down significant events and order them chronologically.
	- Works best with a little homework. "Please spend 10 minutes thinking of 3 things that happened during the run up to the release of Engage. They can be good, bad, or ugly. Write down **the what** and **the when**, one event per sticky, and bring your them to the rutro."
	- Draw a long timeline, with a :) above and a :( below
	- Form groups of 3 and place them on the timeline.
- **5 Whys - 20m**. Drill down to the root cause of problems by repeatedly asking 'Why?'.
	- Doesn't have to be five.
	- Given the number of things on the timeline, break up into a few small groups and do a 5 whys separately.
- **Low Hanging Fruit - 10m**.  Visualize promise and ease of possible courses of actions to help pick.
    - Take root causes from the previous step and plot them on effort / impact axes. Draw the axes on a whiteboard so you can redraw them if everything ends up in the top right!
    - Take the ones in Low effort / High impact, record the ones in High effort / Low impact.
- **Follow Through**. What's the probability of action items getting implemented?
	- Each tiny team pick a sticky, discuss and add a %.
	- Check another team's sticky. Add a sticky with an idea to up the %.
