- Why Retrospectives? (#46)
  -  Ask 'Why do we do retrospectives?' Write down all answers for everyone to see.
- Speedboat / Sailboat (#19) 
  - Analyze what forces push you forward and what pulls you back. Draw a boat with a big sail and a big anchor. Write stickies and put them in the appropriate place.
- 5 Whys (#8)
  -  Drill down to the root cause of problems by repeatedly asking 'Why?'. There may be multiple branches at each level.
- Circles & Soup / Circle of Influence (#29) 
  - Inner to outer levels: 'Team controls - Direct action', 'Team influences - Persuasive/recommending action', 'The soup - Response action'.
- Pleased & Surprised (#45)
  - A quick round asking "what pleased or surprised you about the retro?"
